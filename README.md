A live version of this site can be found on Heroku: https://reactproapi.herokuapp.com/

### App overview
This is a website where students can find all coding schools in the UK. When selected the relevant school you will be able to see a Languages Taught, Description, Contact, Address and you can visit their website by clicking on the Go To Website button.

## Process
We started building the website by installing yarn, package.json, webpack.config.js and babel. 
After that we moved onto creating different components like ......{>>>>>}}}}}} MISSING PART!!!!

## Challenges
The first big challenge was when we had to filter the data by countries since in the API there was a list of over 5000 schools in the world and we only wanted the ones in the UK.

Another problem was that in the API there are no images/logos of the schools so we had to add few in CSS which took a while.

One thing that I've learned by making this website is that next time we need to spend more time in searching for a good API that will give us more information instead of us adding it manually also becase we had only two days to build it.

### Wins
Using Bulma made the styling very easy even if we didn't have enough time to complete everything properly. 
One great feature is that you can filter down your search by location.

I'm also very proud that we managed to filter all the schools so that we would be able to get a list of coding schools in UK only.

## Future features
If we had more time we would've liked to have the website mobile responsive and I would love to add more image/logo for the different schools. It would be nice to add all the contact info on all the schools but this is a field that it's not always given by the API.
